# Handgesture_04
üñêÔ∏è Hand Gesture Recognition Model: Overview

Data Exploration: Verified the number of images per gesture and visualized sample images to understand the dataset. üõ†Ô∏è Data Preprocessing Image Processing: Resized all images to 150x150 pixels and converted them to grayscale. Flattened images and normalized pixel values. Label Encoding: Encoded gesture labels for model training.  Model Building Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Constructed a CNN with multiple convolutional and pooling layers to extract features from images. Added dense layers for classification. Model Training and Evaluation Training: Split data into training and testing sets. Trained the model using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. Utilized callbacks like ModelCheckpoint, EarlyStopping, TensorBoard, CSVLogger, and ReduceLROnPlateau for efficient training. Evaluation: Achieved a training accuracy of 99.98% and testing accuracy of 99.90%. Visualized training and validation loss and accuracy to monitor performance. Results and Submission Model Performance: Evaluated model on test data and confirmed high accuracy. Plotted loss and accuracy graphs for training and validation sets.  Summary Developed a robust hand gesture recognition model that accurately identifies and classifies hand gestures. This model can be integrated into gesture-based control systems for intuitive human-computer interactions.
